> **Abstract:** *While  unsupervised  domain  adaptation  methods  based  ondeep architectures have achieved remarkable success in many computervision tasks, they rely on a strong assumption, i.e. labeled source datamust be available. In this work we overcome this assumption and we ad-dress the problem of transferring knowledge from a source to a target do-main when both source and target data have no annotations. Inspired byrecent works on deep clustering, our approach leverages information fromdata gathered from multiple source domains to build a domain-agnosticclustering model which is then refined at inference time when target databecome available. Specifically, at training time we propose to optimize anovel information-theoretic loss which, coupled with domain-alignmentlayers, ensures that our model learns to correctly discover semantic labelswhile discarding domain-specific features. Importantly, our architecturedesign ensures that at inference time the resulting source model can beeffectively adapted to the target domain without having access to sourcedata, thanks to feature alignment and self-supervision. We evaluate theproposed approach in a variety of settings, considering several domainadaptation  benchmarks  and  we  show  that  our  method  is  able  to  au-tomatically  discover  relevant  semantic  information  even  in  presence  offew target samples and yields state-of-the-art results on multiple domainadaptation benchmarks. We make our source code public.*

## 2. Proposed Method

Our ACIDS framework operates in two phases: training on the source domains and adaptation to the target domain.

In the first phase, we employ an information-theoretic loss based on mutual information maximization to discover clusters in the source domains. In order to favor the emergence of clusters based on semantic information rather than domain style differences, we propose the use of a novel mutual information loss for domain alignment which is paired with BN-based feature alignment.

In the second phase, we perform adaptation to the target domain using a variant to the mutual information loss used in the first phase which uses high confidence points as pivots to stabilize the adaptation process.

## 4. Configuration and Execution

We provide a Conda environment that we recommend for code execution. The environment can be recreated by executing

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activate the environment using

`conda activate acids`

Execution of the model is composed of two phases. The first consists in training on the source domains and is performed with the following command

`python -m codebase.scripts.cluster.source_training --config config/<source_training_config_file>`

Once training on the source domains is completed, adaptation to the target domain is performed with the following command. Note that the first execution will only create the results directory and return an error. A valid checkpoint named `start.pth.tar` originating from the source domain training phase must inserted in the newly created directory and will be taken as the starting point from which to perform adaptation to the target domain.

`python -m codebase.scripts.cluster.target_adaptation --config config/<target_adaptation_config_file>`

The state of each training process can be monitored with

`tensorboard --logdir results/<results_dir>/runs`

## 5. Data

The PACS, Office31 and Office-Home datasets must be placed under the `data` directory and each image must be resized to the resolution of 150x150px. For conveniency, we provide an already configured version of each dataset.
